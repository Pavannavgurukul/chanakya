# Chanakya

Chanakya is the platform we use to let the new students answer the NavGurukul assessment before they get into NavGurukul. The admission flow after answering the test will eventually also be handled inside Chanakya.

## Git Flow
Let's say you decide to work on issue `#34` from the list of our Github issues. Here's how the git flow would look like.

1. Pull out a branch from `master`. (Till the time we are working on v2 you can pull out a branch from `dev` as that has the most stable v2 code.)
2. Make your changes.
3. Do a pull request from your branch into `master` (or `dev` if you are working on v2)
4. Mark `@rishabhverma` as the reviewer of your pull request.
5. Remind the lazy `@rishabhverma` to approve your pull request.
